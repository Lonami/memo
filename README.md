# memo

> *Disclaimer: this project does not condone the illegal use of the tool.*

*memo* is a tool to read memory from a process and perform several shenanigans with it.

You can read this series in the form of blog posts over at [Writing our own Cheat Engine: Introduction][blog].

The name is short for **memo**ry, and in Spanish it means dull, simple, foolish. I think it's a cute name though. *woce* is a strong candidate, but it's nowhere as good as *memo*.
